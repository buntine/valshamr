============================================

 1. Introduction

   The val-compact tool is part of the Valshamr suite. It's sole purpose is to compact
   a full-formed IPv6 address into it's double-colon notation equivalent. It will work
   with both full (e.g 0000:0000:0000:FF11:0090:88CD:1ED2:000A) and 
   semi-full (e.g 180:8:0:0:0:0:FFF1:FF88) addresses.


 2. Usage

   # Standare usage. This will return the IPv6 address in it's compact form.
   compactor = Valshamr::Compact.new "1080:0000:0000:0000:0000:0800:C0A8:1ED2"
   compactor.compact
   => "1080:0:0:0:0:800:C0A8:1ED2"

   # You can also compact the address down to double-colon version.
   compactor = Valshamr::Compact.new "1080:0000:0000:0000:0000:0800:C0A8:1ED2"
   compactor.compact(:tiny)
   => "1080::800:C0A8:1ED2"

   # Note, the IP address will default to localhost if nothing is supplied.
   compactor = Valshamr::Compact.new
   compactor.compact(:tiny)
   => "::1"

   The Valshamr suite ships with a command-line tool that implements this library.
