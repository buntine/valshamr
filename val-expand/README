 1. Introduction

   The val-expand tool is part of the Valshamr suite. It's sole purpose is to expand
   a well-formed IPv6 address from double-colon notation into it's full form.


 2. Usage

   # Standare usage. This will return the IPv6 address in it's full form (without leading zeroes).
   ipng = Valshamr::Expand.new "1080::800:C0A8:1ED2"
   ipng.expand
   => "1080:0:0:0:0:800:C0A8:1ED2"

   # You can also instruct the transformer to add in leading zeroes, so all 32 characters appear (+ seven colons).
   ipng = Valshamr::Expand.new "1080::800:C0A8::1ED2"
   ipng.expand :long
   => "1080:0000:0000:0000:0000:0800:C0A8:1ED2"

   # Note, the IP address will refault to localhost if nothing is supplied.
   ipng = Valshamr::Expand.new
   ipng.expand
   => "0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1"

   The Valshamr suite ships with a command-line tool that implements this library.
