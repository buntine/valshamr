============================================
 Valshamr v0.1
 By Andrew Buntine, 2008
============================================

 1. Introduction

   Valshamr is a collection of small, attachable
   tools (written in Ruby) that perform some common
   IPv6-related tasks.

   Specifically:

     - Transform IPv4 address to it's IPv6 equivalent. (val-ipng)
     - Contract an IPv6 address to double-colon notation. (val-compact)
     - Expand an IPv6 address from dp-notation to it's full form. (val-expand)

   They can read STDIN, so you can pipe to them...


 2. Installation and Usage

   See the tool-specific README files for instructions. e.g ./val-ipng/README


 3. Notes

   - This is more-so a symptom of the badass coffee I just bought
     rather than an attempt to write something truly useful.

   - In Norse mythology, Valshamr is a cloak of falcon feathers owned by Freyja.
     It gives her the ability to morph into the guise of any bird and fly between
     worlds!
