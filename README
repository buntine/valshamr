 Valshamr v0.1
 By Andrew Buntine, 2008
============================================

 Valshamr is a collection of small, attachable
 tools (written in Ruby) that perform some common
 IPv6-related tasks.

 Specifically:

   - Transform IPv4 address to it's IPv6 equivalent.
   - Contract an IPv6 address to double-point notation.
   - Expand an IPv6 address from dp-notation to it's full form.

 They can read STDIN, so you can pipe to them...

 NOTE: This is more-so a symptom of the badass coffee I just bought
       rather than an attempt to write something truly useful.

 NOTE: In Norse mythology, Valshamr is a cloak of falcon feathers owned by Freyja.
       It gives her the ability to morph into the guise of any bird and fly between
       worlds!
