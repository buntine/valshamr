============================================
 Valshamr v0.1
 By Andrew Buntine, 2008
============================================

 1. Introduction

   Valshamr is a collection of small, attachable
   tools (written in Ruby) that perform some common
   IPv6-related tasks.

   Specifically:

     - Transform IPv4 address to it's IPv6 equivalent. (val-ipng)
     - Contract an IPv6 address to short and/or double-colon notation. (val-compact)
     - Expand an IPv6 address from dc-notation to it's full form. (val-expand)

   I have included a few little Ruby scripts that implement each class. They can accept
   STDIN, so you can pipe to them (and to each other)...


 2. Installation and Usage

   See the tool-specific README files for instructions on in-code usage. e.g ./val-ipng/README

   To use the sample scripts:

   $ ./script/ipng.rb 203.32.120.10
   > ::CB20:780A

   $ ./script/expand.rb ::CB20:780A
   > 0:0:0:0:0:0:CB20:780A

   $ ./script/expand.rb --long 1080:90::CDE1:FF22
   > 1080:0090:0000:0000:0000:0000:CDE1:FF22

   $ ./script/compact.rb 1080:0090:0000:0000:0000:0000:CDE1:FF22
   > 1080:90:0:0:0:0:CDE1:FF22

   $ ./script/compact.rb --tiny 1080:0090:0000:0000:0000:0000:CDE1:FF22
   > 1080:90::CDE1:FF22

   All scripts can accept STDIN, so you can pipe between them. For example:

   $ ./script/ipng.rb 203.32.120.10 | ./script/expand.rb --long
   > 0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:CB20:780A


 3. Notes

   - This is more-so a symptom of the badass coffee I just bought rather than an 
     attempt to write something truly useful. I am also experimenting with differing
     packaging/distribution concepts.

   - In Norse mythology, Valshamr is a cloak of falcon feathers owned by Freyja.
     It gives her the ability to morph into the guise of any bird and fly between
     worlds!
