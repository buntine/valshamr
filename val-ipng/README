============================================

 1. Introduction

   The val-ipng tool is part of the Valshamr suite. It's sole purpose is to transform
   a well-formed IPv4 address into it's IPv6 equivelant.


 2. Usage

   # Standare usage. This will return the IPv6 equivelant in double-point notation (compacted). 
   ipng = Valshamr::IPng.new "192.168.30.210"
   ipng.transform
   => "::C0A8:1ED2"

   # Note, the IP address will refault to localhost if nothing is supplied.
   ipng = Valshamr::IPng.new
   ipng.transform
   => "::7F00:0001"

   The Valshamr suite ships with a command-line tool that implements this library.


 3. Notes

   IPng stands for Internet Protocol, the Next Generation. Yes, it is a reference to Star Trek!
   This is actually an official name for the IPv6 protocol suite according to RFC 1752.
