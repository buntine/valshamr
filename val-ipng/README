============================================

 1. Introduction

   The val-ipng tool is part of the Valshamr suite. It's sole purpose is to transform
   a well-formed IPv4 address into it's IPv6 equivelant.

   It runs from the terminal and can accept STDIN (for poping, etc).


 2. Usage

   # Standare usage. This will return the IPv6 equivelant in double-point notation (compacted). 
   $ val-ipng 127.0.0.1

   # You can also expand the returned value by using the -e or --expand switch
   $ val-ipng --expand 12.168.10.100


 3. Notes

   IPng stands for Internet Protocol, the Next Generation. Yes, it is a reference to Star Trek!
   This is actually an official name for the IPv6 protocol suite.
